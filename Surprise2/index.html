              <p>I am not really sure how to put it, but itâ€™s been the most pleasant springs, the summers, and the falls of my life which I have spent in your company; although they mightâ€™ve still been pleasant without having you met but I am certain they would have been less elegant than what they were with having you right there. I can easily say you are a great friend and likely the most gentle person I've ever been with.... I will never judge  you because I never want you any other way, flaws and all (finding flaws is hard though except for pakora sort of nose). You renewed my faith in good humans and actually being able to deeply connect with someone without fear. I am never more at ease then when I'm with you, it's like talking to me myself.<br>

              I have travelled the world, technicolournurd, and I still haven't met a girl as ugly badboodar as you are. Iâ€™ll not waste this opportunity to confess that Iâ€™m grateful that life has privileged me with your blissful presence -- no matter how shortly; but any given time, they say, is made out of infinite number of moments and I am lucky to live an infinity with you.<br>

              Coming back to the actual matter, Happy birthday, Dummyhead. I shall congratulate you on completing another tour round the Sun, and I wish you all the best for your next tour, and I hope it to be better than any youâ€™ve had before. I hope that the day treats you well and gives you plenty to smile about - and this entire year
              Happpyyy happyy birthday!</p>
